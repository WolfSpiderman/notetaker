## Description

This challenge was given to me by the Washington University Coding Boot Camp. We were tasked with building the back end of a note-taking app that we were given the front end for and connect it to the front end. The app allows users to save notes with a title and a lengthier body, and they will remain until they are deleted. I learned a lot of back end development while working on this project, and about the many different tools we have access to for back end development. I also learned more about some of the tools we're already using, specifically the live server extension, and that that doesn't work well when using express servers.

## Installation

The application can be accessed through Heroku.

## Usage

The application can be found [here](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/wsm-notetaker). 

When launching the application, the user will initially see the opening screen with a button to continue to the note-taking app. After clicking it, the user will be presented with any of their previous notes listed on the left side of the screen, and a blank section for entering a new note on the right. When they click on a previous note, the note will be displayed on the right section. When the new note (+) button in the top right is clicked, it will reset the right section for new note entry. When the user begins to input text in the new note section, a save button will appear near the new note button, which will save the current note when clicked, and display the new note on the left side with the other previous notes. Each of the previous notes also have a trash logo next to them that will delete the note when clicked.
